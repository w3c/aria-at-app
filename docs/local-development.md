# Local Development for ARIA-AT Report

## Dependencies
1. Node
    - Version >= 10.13.0 and < 13
    - It is recommended to install node with [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. Yarn
    - Yarn is resposible for installing dependencies, similar to npm. This project is utilizing yarn workspaces to organize the code into a monorepo structure.
    - For macOS, use: `brew install yarn`
    - For linux, See [yarn documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)

## Running the application locally

1. Install Dependencies with Yarn
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
2. Set up local database using the instructions provided in [database.md](database.md).
3. Run the server
    ```
    yarn dev
    ```
Now you can navigate your browser to: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You need to use localhost instead of `0.0.0.0` because the cookie needs to be treated as secure.

## Debugging

Instead of running `yarn dev` to start the local enviornment run `yarn run dev-debug`.

This will add [express debuging](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/debugging.html)
to information about routes, middleware and the request responce cycle.

Additionally it adds the the ability for you use chrome dev tools and a
`debbuger` to step through code via node's build in
[inspector](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/). Just
navigate to [chrome://inspect/#devices](chrome://inspect/#devices) and open the
dedicated dev tools for node.

## Testing

### Running all tests

Setup the test database by running the following commands:
    ```
    yarn db-init:test
    yarn sequelize:test db:migrate
    yarn sequelize:test db:seed:all
    ```

The following command encompasses running the linter, formatter, Jest tests, and Lighthouse accessibility checks only once.
    ```
    yarn test
    ```

### Linting and formatting

Code linting is performed by **ESLint**. To manually run ESLint:
    ```
    yarn lint
    ```

Code formatting is performed by **Prettier**. To manually run Prettier:
    ```
    yarn prettier
    ```

### Unit tests

* React application tests are located in `client/tests`.
* Express server tests are located in `server/tests`.
* Both the client and server side user **Jest** for testing.
    * The client side, additionally, uses **Enzyme** to test React output
    * The server side, additionally, user **Supertest** to test HTTP integration

The following command will run all unit tests.
    ```
    yarn jest
    ```

If running the tests on demand, in a hot-loaded way, run the following for each workspace with the --watchAll command. The downside to this approach is that separate terminals have to be used to run each command.

    ```
    # Run all client tests and watch for changes
    yarn workspace client jest --watchAll

    # Run all server tests and watch from changes
    yarn workspace server jest --watchAll
    ```


### Accessibility testing

#### Manual accessibilty testings

There are some automatable accessibility checks, but the only real way to know whether a webpage is accessible is to access it with a screen reader.

If you have a linux computer, you will have to download a Windows VM in order to test the application with NVDA or JAWS. Here are the basic instructions:
* Enable virtualization in your BIOS settings
* Download [VirtualBox](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/)
* Download a [Windows VM](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines)
* Import the downloaded VM with the default settings.
* Start the virtual machine and download JAWS or NVDA.
* Click the windows button and type "notepad" and click "Run Notepad as administrator"
    * Click "File > Open" and open the file: `Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`
    * Add the following lines to the end of the file:
    ```
    10.0.2.2       localhost
    10.0.2.2       127.0.0.1
    ```
* Click the windows button and type "command" and click "Run Command Prompt as administrator"
    * Then write the following commands:
    ```
    netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=127.0.0.1 listenport=3000 connectaddress=10.0.2.2 connectport=3000
    netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=127.0.0.1 listenport=5000 connectaddress=10.0.2.2 connectport=5000
    ```
* Now open your browser, and navigate to: `localhost:3000` and log in, and turn
  on the screen reader. There are several helpful [guides](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/) to the keyboard shortcuts used. 


#### Automated accessibility tests

[Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) is used for automated accessibility testing of the React application. It has also been integrated into the CI workflow To run the Lighthouse tests, run:
    ```
    yarn a11y
    ```

## Best Practices

Before submitting a pull request, please run `yarn test` to ensure formatting, linting, and passing tests. The CI system will pick up on failing tests, in addition to local testing.
