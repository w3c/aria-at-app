 * Using transactions is necessary to prevent the database from being
 * corrupted when errors occur during API requests. Only after a request has
 * been fully handled without errors should the transaction be committed and
 * the changes applied to the database.
 *
 * The transaction will be available in Express via `req.transaction, and in
 * GraphQL via `context.transaction`.
 *
 * It is possible to persist a transaction over multiple requests using the
 * "x-transaction-id" header. This is useful if multiple requests should
 * commit or roll back together (this is used to reset the database state in
 * end-to-end tests)
